# Implement Spring Security with Authentication.
## DESCRIPTION

## Project objective: 

As a developer, build Authentication Provider in Spring Security.


Background of the problem statement: 

You have been assigned a task by the team to add more flexibility rather than using the standard scenario in building Spring Security.

Following requirements should be met: 

   * You should have a spring MVC web application as part of your submission. (JSP or Thymeleaf are both acceptable front-ends)
   * User Password style in-memory storage is acceptable but variations on this (such as storing to database) are also acceptable.
   * Users should be redirected to a login.html page if not authenticated before being redirected to the original page once authenticated.
   * A few of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked  files which are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.


### Hints

You can find a discussion on implementing Spring Security in the [Spring Online Documentation.](https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/)

Here is another example that uses JSPs rather than Thymleaf: [JSP Example](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-login).
