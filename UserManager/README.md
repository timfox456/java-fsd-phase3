# Searching for a Specific User and Updating the User Information.
## DESCRIPTION

## Project objective:

Create a Spring MVC web application that will retrieve users based on their user ID. The retrieved user data will then be edited in a form and updated in the database. The entire database processing has to be done using Hibernate. Front pages will be made in JSP.

### Background of the problem statement:


As a part of developing an ecommerce web application, the admin backend requires a module that can retrieve users based on their user ID and update their information as required.


### You must use the following:
 

 *  Eclipse as the IDE
 *  Apache Tomcat as the web server (Embedded in jar is fine)
 *  Spring MVC with Hibernate, log4j, and MySQL Connector

 

### Following requirements should be met:

 *  Create a JSP page to take in a user ID
 *  Create a controller that will validate the user ID. If it is invalid, it will display a JSP page with an error message. If it is valid, it will retrieve user details from the database and show an edit form in JSP
 *  Once the edit form is submitted, the controller will update the details in the database. A confirmation JSP page will be shown
 *  Follow the standard methodology of creating controllers, services, respository, and entity classes
 *  Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task

#### JSP Pages

Here is a potential list of JSPs for the project. (feel free to modify)

 * Index
 * Query User By ID
 * Error for Invalid User Id
 * Edit form for User
 * Confirmation JSP
